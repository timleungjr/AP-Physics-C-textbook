\section{Projectile Motion}
A \textbf{projectile} is an object that is launched with an initial velocity
of $\bm V_0$ at an angle $\theta$ with the horizontal. It travels along a
parabolic trajectory and accelerates only due to gravity, as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:projectile}.

In general, when solving a projectile motion project:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
\item the $x$-axis ($\iii$ direction) is defined as the \emph{horizontal}
  direction, with the ($+$) direction pointing forward
\item the $y$-axis ($\jjj$ direction) is the \emph{vertical} direction, with
  the ($+$) direction pointing upwards
\item the origin of the coordinate system is where the projectile is launched
\item the launch angle is ($+$) if it is above the horizontal, and ($-$) if it
  is below
\end{itemize}
This set up is consistent with the standard right-handed Cartesian coordinate
system. The initial velocity $\bm V_0$ can be resolved into its $\iii$ and
$\jjj$ components, $\bm u_0$ and $\bm v_0$:
\begin{equation}
  \bm V_0 =\bm u_0+\bm v_0
  =\left[V_0\cos\theta\right]\iii + \left[V_0\sin\theta\right]\jjj
\end{equation}
where $V_0=|\bm V_0|$.

\subsection{Motion in the Horizontal Direction}
There is no acceleration (i.e.\ $a_x=0$) along the $\iii$ direction, therefore
horizontal velocity is a constant $u=u_0$. The kinematic equations are reduce
to a single equation that relates the horizontal position (displacement) $x$ as
a function of time:
\begin{equation}
  x(t)=u_0t=\left[V_0\cos\theta\right] t
  \label{eq:x}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Motion in the Vertical Direction}
There is a constant acceleration due to gravity alone along the $\jjj$
direction, i.e.\ $a_y=-g$. (Acceleration is \emph{negative} due to the fact that
the positive $y$-axis points upwards.) The kinematic equations along the
vertical direction are therefore:
\begin{align}
  y(t) &= \left[V_0\sin\theta\right]t-\frac12gt^2\label{eq:y}\\
  v(t) &= \left[V_0\sin\theta\right] -gt\\
  \left[v(y)\right]^2&=V_0^2\sin^2\theta-2gy
  \label{eq:maxh}
\end{align}

\subsection{Solving Projectile Motion Problem}
For most projectile motion problems, Eqs.~\ref{eq:x} and \ref{eq:y} are the
most often used. Because $\iii$ and $\jjj$ directions are orthogonal, and
therefore \emph{linearly independent}, horizontal and vertical displacements
$x(t)$ and $y(t)$ are independent of each other. However, there are also
variables that are shared in both directions, namely:
\begin{itemize}[nosep,leftmargin=12pt]
\item Time $t$
\item Launch angle $\theta$
\item Initial speed $V_0$
\end{itemize}
When solving for most projectile motion problems, there likely will be two
unknowns that need to be solved (although you may not be explicitly told what
one of them is), requiring two equations (the $x$ and $y$ kinematic equations).
In some rare cases, if an object lands on an incline, there will be a third
equation describing the relationship between $x$ and $y$ of the incline.

\subsection{Parabolic Path}
We can easily see that the path of a projectile is entirely parabolic. When
solving for the flight time in the $x$ direction (Eq.~\ref{eq:x}), we get:
\begin{equation}
  t=\frac x{V_0\cos\theta}
  \label{eq:t1}
\end{equation}
Substituting Eq.~\ref{eq:t1} into Eq.~\ref{eq:y}, we have
\begin{align}
  y &=\left(V_0\sin\theta\right) t-\frac12gt^2\nonumber\\
  &= \left(V_0\sin\theta\right)\left(\frac x{V_0\cos\theta}\right)-\frac12g
  \left(\frac x{V_0\cos\theta}\right)^2\nonumber\\
  y&=\left(\tan\theta\right) x-\left(\frac g{2V_0^2\cos^2\theta}\right)x^2
\end{align}
It is clear that the $y$ is quadratic in $x$, and therefore the path is a
parabola in space.

\subsection{Symmetric Projectiles}
A projectile's trajectory is \emph{symmetric} where an object is launched an
angle of $\theta$ (between \ang{0} and \ang{90}) above the
horizontal%\footnote{This may be obvious, but angles \emph{below} the
%horizontal will never have a symmetric trajectory.} and then
lands at the same height. Examples may include hitting a golf ball towards the
hole, or shooting a bullet toward a horizontal target\footnote{Shooting a
bullet toward a horizontal target always require an upward angle because of
gravity.}
%\footnote{Note that the equations for symmetric trajectory are \emph{not}
%  included in the AP Exam equation sheet; if you need these equations during
%sma  the exams, you will need to derive them yourself. Thankfully, the derivation
%  is striaghtforward.}

Applying the kinematic equation first in the $\jjj$ direction. When the object
lands at the same height at time $T$, the final displacement is $y(T)=0$:
\begin{equation*}
  y(T)=V_0\sin\theta T-\frac12gT^2=0
\end{equation*}
Solving for $T$ we find the \textbf{total time of flight}:
\begin{equation}
  \boxed{
    T=\frac{2V_0\sin\theta}g
  }
  \label{tmax}
\end{equation}
Not surprisingly, a projectile will stay in the air the longest when it is
launched at $\theta=\ang{90}$.
%\footnote{As a fun exercise, for a known initial
%  speed $V_0$, you can plot $t$ vs.\ $\sin\theta$ to find the acceleration due
%  to gravity $g$!}
Mathematically, there is a second (trivial\footnote{Trivial means
\emph{unimportant}}) solution, at $T=0$. Of course, it just means that the
project has zero vertical displacement at the moment when it is launched.

Next, we apply the kinematic equation (Eq.~\ref{eq:maxh}) in the $\jjj$
direction. Recognizing that at maximum height $y=H$, the vertical component of
velocity is zero $v(H)=0$:
\begin{equation*}
  v^2 = V_0^2\sin^2\theta-2gH = 0
\end{equation*}
Solving for $H$, we get the equation for \textbf{maximum height}:
\begin{equation}
  \boxed{H=\frac{V_0^2\sin^2\theta}{2g}}
\end{equation}
The maximum height also (not surprisingly) has a maximum value when
$\theta=\ang{90}$.

Finall, we substitute the expression for total time of flight $T$ from
Eq.~\ref{tmax} into the $t$ term, then apply the kinematic equation in the
$\iii$ irection to compute the \textbf{range} $R=x(T)$ for any given launch
angle and initial speed:
\begin{equation}
  R=x(T)=u_0T=V_0\cos\theta\left[\frac{2V_0\sin\theta}g\right]
  \label{step1}
\end{equation}
Using the trigonometric identity $\sin(2\theta)=2\sin\theta\cos\theta$,
Eq.~\ref{step1} simplifies to:
\begin{equation}
  \boxed{R=\frac{V_0^2\sin(2\theta)}g}
\end{equation}
It is obvious that for any given initial speed $V_0$, the maximum range
$R_\text{max}$ occurs at an angle where $\sin(2\theta)=1$ (i.e.\
$\theta=\ang{45}$), with a value of
\begin{equation}
  \boxed{R_\text{max}=\frac{V_0^2}g}
\end{equation}
Also, for a known initial speed $V_0$ and range $R$ we can compute the launch
angle $\theta$:
\begin{displaymath}
  \theta_1=\frac12\sin^{-1}\left(\frac{gR}{V_0^2}\right)
\end{displaymath}
This angle is labelled $\theta_1$ because it is \emph{not} the only angle that
can reach this range. Recall that for any angle $0<\phi_1<\ang{180}$, there
is also another angle $\phi_2=\ang{180}-\phi_1$ where sine of the angles has the
same value:
\begin{displaymath}
  \sin\phi=\sin(\ang{180}-\phi)
\end{displaymath}
Which means that for any $\theta_1$, there is also another angle $\theta_2$
where $2\theta_2=\ang{180}-2\theta_1$, or simply:
\begin{equation}
  \boxed{
    \theta_1+\theta_2=\ang{90}
  }
\end{equation}
