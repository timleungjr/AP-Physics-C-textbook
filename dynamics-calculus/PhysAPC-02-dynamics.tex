While \textbf{kinematics} describes the motion of any object mathematically,
\textbf{dynamics} describes \emph{what} causes motion to change


\section{Forces}


\section{Laws of Motion}

The first law of motion, as stated in \emph{Principia}, says that:
\begin{center}
  \fcolorbox{black}{cyan!10}{
    \begin{minipage}{.74\textwidth}
      \textbf{Law \#1: An object will remain in its state of rest or uniform
        motion, until a net external force is applied to it.}\footnote{Lex I:
      Corpus omne perseverare in statu suo quiescendi vel movendi uniformiter
      in directum, nisi quatenus a viribus impressis cogitur statum illum
      mutare.}
    \end{minipage}
  }
\end{center}
This called, called the \emph{law of equilibrium}, states that when the sum
of all the forces acting on an object is balanced, the velocity of the object
will not change.

When the net force on an object is zero ($\sum\bm F=\bm 0$) then the
object is in a \emph{state of translational equilibrium}. Equilibrium can be
either:
\begin{itemize}[nosep,leftmargin=12pt]
\item\textbf{dynamic equilibrium} when the object is moving relative to the
  observer), or
\item\textbf{static equilibrium}, when the object is not moving relative to the
  observer
\end{itemize}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Uniform motion means constant velocity; an object ``at rest'' is also
%  in uniform motion with $\bm v=\bm 0$
%\item As long as an object moves in uniform motion, it must be that
%  
%\item Common examples:
%  \begin{itemize}
%  \item A hockey puck sliding on very smooth ice has gravity and normal
%    force, but the net force is zero
%  \item A car traveling on a highway at \SI{100}{\kilo\metre\per\hour}
%    has many forces acting on it, but the net force is zero 
%  \end{itemize}
%\item{\color{red!80!black}This is a special case that assumes a constant
%  mass}
%\end{itemize}

%\subsubsection{Aristotle: The Wrong Interpretation}
Prior to Galileo, the understanding of motion came primarily from Greek
philosopher Aristotle, who said that any body in motion will come its
natural state: at rest. Aristotle's idea ``makes sense'' from everyday
experience. For example: slide a book across a table, it will eventually stop.
However, Galileo pointed out that Aristotle's philosophy is ambiguous: absolute
rest cannot be determined because all motion is relative.

\textbf{Absolute rest cannot be determined:} Objects that are stationary in one
coordinate system can be moving relative to another (see \emph{relative motion}
from last class). A cup of water, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:cup}, is on the tray
table on an airplane in flight. The cup is stationary relative to the
passengers, but moving relative to anyone outside watching the airplane fly by.
\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \pic{.4}{../dynamics-calculus/coffeecup}
  \caption{A cup of water on an airplane is flight is stationary only
    passengers on the airplane, but not to observers outside}
  \label{fig:cup}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Uniform motion is indistinguishable from rest:} If I drop a tennis ball
while standing on the ground (Fig~\ref{fig:tennisball}), the ball falls
straight down with an acceleration due to gravity. If I repeat this while on an
airplane travelling in uniform motion (i.e.\ constant velocity) in the air, I
will observe exactly the same thing. The motion of the ball gives me no
information about whether I am at rest on in uniform motion
\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \pic{.4}{../dynamics-calculus/Aging-Self-2}
  \caption{Observing the motion of a dropped tennis ball gives no hint as to
    whether you are stationary or moving in uniform motion.}
  \label{fig:tennisball}
\end{figure}
  
\begin{center}
  \fcolorbox{black}{cyan!10}{
    \begin{minipage}{.7\textwidth}
      \textbf{Law \#2: The acceleration of an object is proportional to,
        and along the direction of, the net external force.}\footnote{Lex II:
      Mutationem motus proportionalem esse vi motrici impressae, et fieri
      secundum lineam rectam qua vis illa imprimitur.}
    \end{minipage}
  }
\end{center}

Like the first law, the second law of motion as descrribed by Newton is also a
``special case'' that assumes a constant mass. We can summarize the first two
laws into one of the most recognizable equation:
\begin{equation}
  \boxed{
    \bm F_\text{net}(t)=\sum\bm F=m\bm a(t)
  }
\end{equation}

For non-constant mass, net force is the rate of change of momentum $\bm p$.
\begin{equation*}
  \bm F_\text{net}(t)=\diff{\bm p}t
\end{equation*}
The topic of momentum will be studied in more depth in
Chapter~\ref{chapter:momentum}.


\subsection{Defining Mass}
What is \textbf{mass} then? It is
\begin{itemize}
\item the property of an object that relates its acceleration to the force
  applied to it. Literally, it means:
  \begin{equation}
    m\equiv\frac{F_\text{net}}a
  \end{equation}
\item Intrinsic to the object itself
\item This is explicitly referred to as the object's \textbf{inertial mass}
\end{itemize}




\section{Third Law of Motion}
\begin{center}
  \fbox{
    \begin{minipage}{.9\textwidth}
      \textbf{Law \#3: For every action there is always an opposite and
        equal reaction; the mutual actions of two objects on each other are
        always equal, and directed to the other object.}
    \end{minipage}
  }
\end{center}

Whenever object (B) exerts any force on object (A), (A) will immediately
exert a reaction force on (B) that is equal in magnitude but opposite in
direction:
\begin{equation}
  \boxed{\bm F_\text{AB} = -\bm F_\text{BA}}
\end{equation}
\begin{itemize}
\item The action and reaction forces act on different objects!
\item Third law is an application of the first law. Action/reaction forces
  are \emph{internal} forces to the system of objects.
\end{itemize}



\section{Forces}
A \textbf{force} is the interaction between the objects.
\begin{itemize}
\item When there is interaction, then forces are created
\item A ``push'' or a ``pull''
\end{itemize}
There are two broad categories of forces:
\begin{itemize}
\item\textbf{Contact forces} act between two objects that are in contact
  with one another
\item\textbf{Non-contact forces} act between two objects without them
  touching each other. They are also called ``action-at-a-distance'' force
\end{itemize}


Common forces that we encounter may include:
\begin{itemize}[nosep,leftmargin=12pt]
\item Weight (gravitational force) $\bm F_g$
\item Normal force $\bm F_N$
\item Friction force (static $\bm f_s$ and kinetic $\bm f_k$)
\item Tension force $\bm F_T$
\item Applied force $\bm F_a$
\item Spring force $\bm F_s$
\item Aerdynamic drag $\bm F_D$ (a.k.a.\ fluid resistance)
\item Buoyant force $\bm F_B$ (discussed in fluid mechanics, in AP Physics 2)
\item Electrostatic force $\bm F_q$ (discussed in E \& M)
\item Magnetic force $\bm F_m$ (discussed E \& M)
\end{itemize}




\subsection{Gravity}
Gravity is the force of attraction between all objects with mass
\begin{equation}
  \boxed{\bm F_g=m\bm g}
\end{equation}
\begin{itemize}
\item Near surface of Earth, use $g=\SI{9.81}{\metre\per\second\squared}$ (or
  $g=\SI{10}{\metre\per\second\squared}$ for your AP exam)
\item $\bm F_g$ always points \emph{down}
\item Based on the law of universal gravitation:
  \begin{equation*}
    \boxed{F_g=\frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2}}\;\;
    \text{\normalsize where}\;\;
    G=\SI{6.674e-11}{\newton\metre\squared\per\kilo\gram\squared}
  \end{equation*}
\end{itemize}  




\subsection{Normal Force}
\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \draw[thick] (-1,0)--(2.5,0);
    \draw[mass] rectangle (1.5,1);
    \fill (.75,.5) circle (2pt);
    \draw[vector] (.75,.5)--(.75,-.5) node[below]{$\bm F_g$};
    \draw[vector] (.75,.5)--(.75,1.5) node[above]{$\bm F_N$};
  \end{tikzpicture}
    %$\bm F_g=-\bm F_N$\\(special case)
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\item A force a surface exerts on another object that it is in contact with
\item Always \textbf{perpendicular} to the contact surface
\item\textbf{Special case:} When an object is on a horizontal surface
  with no additional applied force, the magnitude of the normal force is
  equal to the magnitude of the weight of the object, i.e.\ $N=mg$
\end{itemize}

The normal force remains perpendicular to the support surface even when it is
at an angle:
\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.9]
    \draw[thick] (0,0)--(5,0);
    \draw[axes] (1.7,0) arc (0:30:1.7) node[pos=.6,right] {$\theta$};
    \begin{scope}[rotate=30]
      \draw[thick] (0,0)--(5,0);
      \draw[mass] (2,0) rectangle (4,1.5);
      \draw[vector,rotate around={-30:(3,.75)}]
      (3,.75)--(3,-1) node[right]{$\bm F_g$};
      \draw[vector,red] (3,.75)--(3,2.25) node[left=-1]{$\bm F_N$};
      \fill (3,.75) circle (.06);
    \end{scope}
  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}
\textbf{Important note:} It is not always clear what the magnitude of the
normal force is. Finding the magnitude of the normal force is part of the
analysis process.

%    \item Weight has a component along the ramp ($mg\sin\theta$) that wants
%      to slide the block down.

%



\subsection{Friction}
\begin{itemize}
\item A force that opposes the sliding of two surface against one another
\item Always act in a direction that opposes motion or attempted motion
\item Depends on:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Normal force $N$: The force the two surfaces are pressed against
    each other
  \item Coefficients of friction ($\mu_s$ and $\mu_k$): Smoothness of the
    surfaces, which itself depends on
    \begin{itemize}
    \item The material(s) the surfaces are made of
    \item The use of lubricants
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\begin{center}
  \pic{.5}{../dynamics-calculus/graphics/friction}
\end{center}




\subsubsection{Static Friction}
When there is no relative motion between the two surface, the friction is
called the \textbf{static friction}
%  \textbf{Static friction} between the two surfaces is when there is no
%  relative motion between them
\begin{itemize}
\item Increases with increasing applied force
\item Maximum when the object is just about to move
\end{itemize}
\begin{equation}
  \boxed{f_s\leq\mu_sN}
\end{equation}
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{l|c|c}
    \rowcolor{pink}
    \textbf{Quantity} & \textbf{Symbol} & \textbf{SI Unit} \\ \hline
    Magnitude of static friction & $f_s$ & \si\newton \\
    Coefficient of static friction & $\mu_s$ & no units \\
    Magnitude of normal force    & $N$ & \si\newton
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}




\subsubsection{Kinetic Friction}
When the two surfaces are moving relative to each other, the friction is
called \textbf{kinetic friction} $f_k$. $f_k$ is approximately constant along
the path of movement as long  as $\bm F_N$ stays constant
\begin{equation}
  \boxed{f_k = \mu_kN}
\end{equation}
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{l|c|c}
    \rowcolor{pink}
    \textbf{Quantity} & \textbf{Symbol} & \textbf{SI Unit} \\ \hline
    Magnitude of kinetic friction & $f_k$ & \si\newton \\
    Coefficient of kinetic friction & $\mu_k$ & no units \\
    Magnitude of normal force & $N$ & \si\newton
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}




%\begin{frame}{Static and Kinetic Coefficients of Friction}    
Coefficient of kinetic friction is always lower than the coefficient for
static friction, otherwise nothing will ever move:
\begin{equation}
  \mu_k\leq\mu_s
\end{equation}

Consider a simple case of a box being pulled along a level floor. The free-body
diagram is simple (left). How do the magnitudes of the applied force $F_a$ and
friction $f$ compare?

%      \draw (0,0)--(0,5) node[left]{$f$};
%    \end{tikzpicture}
  




%\begin{frame}{Tires}
Most people associate friction as the force that slows down things, but very
often friction is what accelerates things. \textbf{Example:} the forward
acceleration of a car is caused by the static friction between the tires and
the road.
\begin{center}
  \pic{.38}{../dynamics-calculus/graphics/all-season-tires}
\end{center}
Tires also generated a force called \emph{rolling resistance} as it rolls
along a road because the weight of the car deforms the tires.





\subsection{Drag}
\label{sec:drag}
When an object moves through a fluid (most gases and liquids), it experiences
a fluid resistance force called \textbf{drag} $\bm F_D$. It is defined as:
\begin{equation}
  \boxed{
    F_D=\frac12\rho v_\infty^2C_DA
  }
\end{equation}
Unlike kinetic friction, drag force scales with the square of the speed of the
object relative to the fluid that it is moving in:
\begin{figure}[ht]
  \pic{.338}{../dynamics-calculus/graphics/boeing787}
  \pic{.35}{../dynamics-calculus/graphics/ganna}
  \pic{.263}{../dynamics-calculus/graphics/submarine}
  \caption{Object moving through fluids will experience a drag force}
  \label{fig:drag}
\end{figure}
At this time, you are not required to know the drag equation, just that
$F_D\propto v^2$, and $F_D\propto A$
%\begin{equation}
%  \boxed{
%    F_D=\frac12\rho v_\infty^2C_DA
%  }
%\end{equation}  
%\begin{center}
%  \begin{tabular}{l|c|c}
%    \rowcolor{pink}
%    \textbf{Quantity} & \textbf{Symbol} & \textbf{SI Unit} \\ \hline
%    Magnitude of drag force & $F_D$     & \si\newton \\
%    Density of the fluid    & $\rho$    & \si{\kilo\gram\per\metre\cubed}\\
%    Free-stream velocity    & $v_\infty$ & \si{\metre\per\second}\\
%    Reference area          & $A$       & \si{\metre\squared}\\
%    Drag coefficient        & $C_D$     & (no unit)
%  \end{tabular}
%\end{center}
Drag force also depends on the \textbf{drag coefficient} $C_D$,
a non-dimensional variable that depends on the shape and surface smoothness of
the object.
For blunt objects (``bluff bodies'') $A$ is the frontal area; for
streamlined objects $A$ is the planform (top-view) area.

When we take drag force into account, we understand that the drag force
increases as an object speeds up, and therefore a free-falling object does
\emph{not} accelerate infinitely. Instead it reaches a
\textbf{terminal velocity}.

%  \textbf{Example:} To move a \SI{45}{kg} wooden crate across a wooden floor
%  ($\mu=0.20$), you tie a rope onto the crate and pull on the rope. While you
%  are pulling the rope with a force of \SI{115}{N}, it makes an angle of
%  \ang{15}
%  with the horizontal. How much time elapses between the time at which the
%  crate just starts to move and the time at which you are pulling it with a
%  velocity of \SI{1.4}{m/s}?
%  \begin{center}
%    \pic{.5}{../dynamics-calculus/graphics/pull-box}
%  \end{center}

%  \textbf{Example:} You are holding an \SI{85}{kg} trunk at the top of a ramp
%  that slopes from a moving van to the ground, making an angle of \ang{35} with
%  the ground. You lose your grip and the trunk begins to slide.
%  \begin{itemize}
%  \item If the coefficient of friction between the trunk and the ramp is
%    $0.42$, what is the acceleration of the trunk?
%  \item If the trunk slides \SI{1.3}{m} before reaching the bottom of the ramp,
%    for what time interval did it slide?
%  \end{itemize}



%  \textbf{Example:} A \SI{55}{kg} person is standing on a scale in an
%  elevator. If
%  the scale is calibrated in \emph{newtons}, what is the reading on the scale
%  when the elevator is not moving? If the elevator begins to accelerate upward
%  at \SI{.75}{m/s^2}, what will be the reading on the scale?




\subsection{Tension Force}
\textbf{Tension} $\bm F_T$ is the force that is transmitted through objects
that can be stretched, e.g.\ a rope that is being pulled
\begin{center}
  \pic{.6}{../dynamics-calculus/graphics/3-rope}
\end{center}
\begin{itemize}
\item Examples: ropes, cables, strings, etc.
\item Tension force can only be transmitted if the cable is fully extended
\item You can't push on a rope
\item Can be used with pulleys to change the direction of force
\end{itemize}




\subsection{Spring Force}
The spring force $\bm F_s$ is the force that a compressed/stretched spring
exerts on the object connected to it.  An \emph{ideal} spring obeys Hooke's
law:
\begin{equation}
  \boxed{\bm F_s=-k\bm x}
\end{equation}
The spring force acts in the opposite direction to the spring's displacement,
and is proportional to the amount of compression/stretching.

\section{Free-Body Diagrams}

Acceleration (if there is going to be any at all) depends on net force
$\bm F_\text{net}$. Without a vector sum of all the forces, we cannot determine
the magnitude, direction of the acceleration, or how acceleration will evolve
in time. To help is visualiz forces acting on an object, we use
\textbf{free-body diagrams} (FBD) to represent all the forces. FBDs are a very
important standard technique when solving any dynamics problems, and is not
a step that should be skipped.

For \emph{rectilinear}, or \emph{translational} motion, FBDs are usually drawn
by assuming that all forces acting at the center of mass (``CM''),
represented by the ``big dot''. For example:
\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.8]
    \fill (1.5,1) circle (.1);
    \draw[vector] (1.5,1)--(1.5,-.5) node[below]{$\bm F_g$};
    \draw[vector] (1.5,1)--(1.5,2.5) node[above]{$\bm F_N$};
    \draw[vector] (1.5,1)--(3.1,1) node[right]{$\bm F_a$};
    \draw[vector] (1.5,1)--(.75,1) node[left] {$\bm f$};
  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}

However, for motion where \emph{rotation} is (at least) a possibility, we
must note that while gravitational force $\bm F_g$ acts at CM, normal
force $\bm F_N$, friction $\bm f$ and applied force $\bm F_a$ all act at the
point of contact, away from the CM. In those cases, forces should be drawn
where they are applied. For example, a sphere rolling down a ramp should have
weight $\bm F_g$, normal force $\bm F_N$ and static friction $\bm f_s$ acting
on it, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:rollingdown1}

Once the FBD is drawn, decide on the axes to help you solve the motion. One of
the axes should line up with the direction of motion. This guarantees that
the \emph{other} axis will not have any net force.

%\begin{frame}{Example Problem}
A more difficult static problem may involve two surfaces with two different
friction coefficients. For example, a ladder leaning on a wall. This problem
cannot be solved without first understanding rotational motion, but we can
still draw a FBD.

\textbf{Example:} A uniform ladder is \SI{5.0}{\metre} long and weighs
\SI{400}\newton. The ladder rests against a slippery vertical wall, as
shown in the figure. The inclination angle between the ladder and the rough
floor is \ang{53}. Find the reaction forces from the floor and
from the wall on the ladder and the coefficient of static friction $\mu_s$
at the interface of the ladder with the floor that prevents the ladder from
slipping.

%\item The objects are connected by a cable or a solid linkage with negligible
%  mass
%\item All objects (usually) have the same acceleration
%\item Require multiple free-body diagrams
%\end{itemize}
%
%
%
%To solve a connected-bodies problem, you can follow these procedures:
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Draw a FBD on each of the objects
%\item Sum all the forces on all the objects along the direction of motion
%  \begin{itemize}
%  \item Direction of motion is usually very obvious
%  \item All internal forces should cancel and do not figure into the
%    acceleration of the system
%  \end{itemize}
%\item Compute the acceleration of the entire system using second law of motion
%  \begin{itemize}
%  \item Remember that (usually) every object has the same acceleration!
%  \end{itemize}
%\item Go back to the FBD of each of the objects and compute the unknown
%  forces (usually tension)
%\end{enumerate}
%
%
%
%%  \textbf{Example:} A tractor-trailer pulling two trailers starts from rest
%%  and accelerates with an acceleration $a$ on a straight, level road. The mass
%%  of the truck (T) is \SI{5450}{\kilo\gram}, the mass of the first trailer (A)
%%  is \SI{31500}{\kilo\gram}, and the mass of the second trailer (B) is
%%  \SI{19600}{\kilo\gram}.
%%  \begin{enumerate}
%%  \item What magnitude of force must the truck generate in order to accelerate
%%    the entire vehicle?
%%  \item What magnitude of force must each of the trailer hitches withstand
%%    while the vehicle is accelerating?
%%  \end{enumerate}
%%  Assume that frictional forces are negligible in comparison with the forces
%%  needed to accelerate the large masses.
